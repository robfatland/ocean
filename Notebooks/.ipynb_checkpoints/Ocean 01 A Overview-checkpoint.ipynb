    "These notebooks tell *data interpretation* stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While data interpretation is the main focus, the mechanics of bringing the \n",
    "data into view are present here as well. Python code is relegated to modules\n",
    "with names like `NotebookModule.py`. This streamlines the notebooks for reading \n",
    "while keeping (hopefully instructive) code close by.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stories: The starting point is the \"shallow profiler\". From there: Expand further\n",
    "into the OOI sensor diaspora; and then introduce datasets from other programs. Other\n",
    "programs include particularly ARGO, MODIS and the ROMS model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial focus on the cabled array shallow profiler needs a link added here. \n",

    "## Science questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions and fragmentary 'answers' are jotted down to begin framing\n",
    "data interpretation stories. Suggestion: Read them as if -- to your sudden astonishment --\n",
    "you found yourself able to hear the thoughts of an oceanographer riding the same bus as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we start at the ocean surface at noon and swim down 200 meters: What happens\n",
    "to the sunlight? Answer: It dwindles to nothing; very dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How deep is the ocean? 3700 meters on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean that 35/37ths of the **entire ocean** is just *dark* all the time? Answer: Yes.\n",
    "Unless one brings a flashlight... or if there are bioluminescent fish... or an erupting volcano happens\n",
    "to be nearby. Mostly it is dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about temperature? Answer: It gets colder as you go down... but never so cold that it freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about salinity? Answer: The water gets slightly saltier as you go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about oxygen dissolved in the water? Answer: Hmmmmm... not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about carbon dioxide? Answer: Not sure. I think this is complicated by \n",
    "what happens to carbon dioxide when it dissolves into sea water. (This is called\n",
    "*carbonate chemistry*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about chlorophyll? Where is that found? Answer: Solar-powered algae are the ocean's version\n",
    "of plants; and for energy just as on land these algae need sunlight. So they are going to prefer to\n",
    "live up above 200 meters depth: where there is light. So as a *guess*: Chlorophyll \n",
    "is at a maximum near the surface. (They use chlorophyll to store energy in the form of sugar.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about particulate backscatter? Fluorescent organic molecules? pH? Nitrates? Isn't iron important?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these \"upper 200 meters\" profiles of the ocean change over the course of a single day?\n",
    "How do they change over a month? A season? A year? Seven years?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these profiles change on the continental shelf? At the subduction boundary? Further offshore in the deep ocean? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than diving and rising at a single location: If we use an autonomous glider to run transect profiles\n",
    "back and forth: Does this not create a kind of \"wall of data\"?  How would such a data wall change our picture of the \n",
    "water column? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How can satellite data expand the view we have of surface waters to more of a map-like representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can surface water maps of temperature or color be augmented to include maps of variations in sea surface height?\n",
    "Answer: Yes. Question: What do those tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we extend the characterization of the water column downward below 200 meters? Can we extend it to other locations?\n",
    "Answer: Yes, particularly by means of an observation program called ARGO. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we explain variations in surface salinity in terms of nearby estuary discharge and coastal marine currents?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This and related questions about surface water conditions suggest an entire field of study: How does \n",
    "the surface of ocean interact with the bottom layer of earth's atmosphere?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Supposing we can identify freshwater pulses offshore in surface layers: Do those freshwater masses have \n",
    "distinctive signatures indicating their history of origination on dry land? (Such water is called 'terrigenous'.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we identify upwelling events along continental margins? \n",

    "## Context of OOI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OOI?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOI stands for Ocean Observatories Initiative. It is a collection of **arrays**,\n",
    "localized collections of sensors and supporting infrastructure. A single array \n",
    "spans an area of typically several thousand square kilometers.\n",
    "There are seven of these arrays in total in OOI: Five in the \n",
    "northern hemisphere and two in the southern ocean. The southern ocean arrays operated and gathered data for \n",
    "a few years starting in 2014; but those sensor deployments have been discontinued. The northern hemisphere arrays are \n",
    "called (in no particular order) the Regional Cabled Array,\n",
    "Global Station Papa Array, Coastal Endurance Array, Coastal Pioneer Array and Global Irminger Sea Array.\n",
    "Each has a unique location(s), history and relevance to global ocean research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the agenda of this repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate data interpretation; both as a *technical process* and\n",
    "in terms of *ocean science*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to dig in to the technical details? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two notebooks devoted to this topic in the **`Notebooks`** sub-folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ocean 08 Programming Resources: Works from a 'how to code this' perspective\n",
    "- Ocean 09 Technical Guide: Works from a 'what needs to happen in what order' perspective\n",

    "## Parameters of the shallow profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow profiler deployments run 2015 to present; with intermittent interruptions due to servicing and *forces majeures*. \n",
    "There are three shallow profilers in the Cabled Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "2. 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "3. 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary, at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and rests 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Platform and Profiler together look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<BR>\n",
    "<img src=\"./Images/rca/shallow%20profiler%20platform%201%20in%20situ.png\" style=\"float: left;\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile it is winched back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean time in minutes for...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ascent:    67\n",
    "Descent:   45      (exception: local noon and midnight descents are about an hour longer)\n",
    "Rest:      45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform.\n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the code I implemented single-letter codes for the various data types.\n",
    "Temperature is stored in an xarray Dataset `dsT`; salinity `dsS` and so on.  \n",
