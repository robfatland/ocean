    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks tell *data interpretation* stories, starting with data\n",
    "collected by the Ocean Observatories Initiative or OOI. Some scientific \n",
    "questions are written out in the **Ocean Science** notebook to provide\n",
    "some context for this interpretation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While data interpretation is the main focus, the mechanics of bringing the \n",
    "data into view are here as well. Python code is relegated to modules\n",
    "with names like `NotebookModule.py`. This streamlines the notebooks for reading \n",
    "while keeping (hopefully instructive) code close by.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository is structured as five chapters. The starting point, chapter one,\n",
    "is the \"shallow profiler\". Chapter two expands further into the OOI sensor diaspora,\n",
    "particularly including glider data, hydrophones and seismic sensors. (Part of \n",
    "the OOI program has been built on an active subsea volcano.)\n",
    "Chapter three brings in datasets from other programs\n",
    "particularly ARGO, MODIS, GLODAP, NANOOS and the ROMS estuary model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter four looks at scientific questions in relation to these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter five provides programming and technical reference material. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To return to the beginning, \n",
    "[shallow profilers] are really \n",
    "two connected entities: The **profiler** and its supporting **platform**. \n",

    "## Context of OOI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OOI?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOI stands for Ocean Observatories Initiative. It is a collection of **arrays**,\n",
    "localized collections of sensors and supporting infrastructure. A single array \n",
    "spans an area of typically several thousand square kilometers.\n",
    "There are seven of these arrays in total in OOI: Five in the \n",
    "northern hemisphere and two in the southern ocean. The southern ocean arrays operated and gathered data for \n",
    "a few years starting in 2014; but those sensor deployments have been discontinued. The northern hemisphere arrays are \n",
    "called (in no particular order) the Regional Cabled Array,\n",
    "Global Station Papa Array, Coastal Endurance Array, Coastal Pioneer Array and Global Irminger Sea Array.\n",
    "Each has a unique location(s), history and relevance to global ocean research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the agenda of this repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate data interpretation; both as a *technical process* and\n",
    "in terms of *ocean science*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to dig in to the technical details? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two notebooks devoted to this topic in the **`Notebooks`** sub-folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ocean 08 Programming Resources: Works from a 'how to code this' perspective\n",
    "- Ocean 09 Technical Guide: Works from a 'what needs to happen in what order' perspective\n",

    "## Parameters of the shallow profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow profiler deployments run 2015 to present; with intermittent interruptions due to servicing and *forces majeures*. \n",
    "There are three shallow profilers in the Cabled Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "2. 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "3. 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary, at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and rests 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Platform and Profiler together look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<BR>\n",
    "<img src=\"../Images/rca/shallow%20profiler%20platform%201%20in%20situ.png\" style=\"float: left;\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile it is winched back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean time in minutes for...\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "Ascent:    67\n",
    "Descent:   45      (exception: local noon and midnight descents are about an hour longer)\n",
    "Rest:      45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform.\n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. "
