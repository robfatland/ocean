    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While data interpretation is the main focus, the mechanics of bringing the \n",
    "data into view are present here as well. Python code is relegated to modules\n",
    "with names like `NotebookModule.py`. This streamlines the notebooks for reading \n",
    "while keeping (hopefully instructive) code close by.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data stories: The starting point is the \"shallow profiler\". From there: Expand further\n",
    "into the OOI sensor diaspora; and then introduce datasets from other programs. Other\n",
    "programs include particularly ARGO, MODIS and the ROMS model.\n",

    "## Science questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions and fragmentary 'answers' are jotted down to begin framing\n",
    "data interpretation stories. Suggestion: Read them as if -- to your sudden astonishment --\n",
    "you found yourself able to hear the thoughts of an oceanographer riding the same bus as you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we start at the ocean surface at noon and swim down 200 meters: What happens\n",
    "to the sunlight? Answer: It dwindles to nothing; very dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How deep is the ocean? 3700 meters on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this mean that 35/37ths of the **entire ocean** is just *dark* all the time? Answer: Yes.\n",
    "Unless one brings a flashlight... or if there are bioluminescent fish... or an erupting volcano happens\n",
    "to be nearby. Mostly it is dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about temperature? Answer: It gets colder as you go down... but never so cold that it freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about salinity? Answer: The water gets slightly saltier as you go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about oxygen dissolved in the water? Answer: Hmmmmm... not sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about carbon dioxide? Answer: Not sure. I think this is complicated by \n",
    "what happens to carbon dioxide when it dissolves into sea water. (This is called\n",
    "*carbonate chemistry*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about chlorophyll? Where is that found? Answer: Solar-powered algae are the ocean's version\n",
    "of plants; and for energy just as on land these algae need sunlight. So they are going to prefer to\n",
    "live up above 200 meters depth: where there is light. So as a *guess*: Chlorophyll \n",
    "is at a maximum near the surface. (They use chlorophyll to store energy in the form of sugar.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we extend the characterization of the water column downward below 200 meters? Can we extend it to other locations?\n",

    "## Context of OOI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OOI?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOI stands for Ocean Observatories Initiative. It is a collection of **arrays**,\n",
    "localized collections of sensors and supporting infrastructure. A single array \n",
    "spans an area of typically several thousand square kilometers.\n",
    "There are seven of these arrays in total in OOI: Five in the \n",
    "northern hemisphere and two in the southern ocean. The southern ocean arrays operated and gathered data for \n",
    "a few years starting in 2014; but those sensor deployments have been discontinued. The northern hemisphere arrays are \n",
    "called (in no particular order) the Regional Cabled Array,\n",
    "Global Station Papa Array, Coastal Endurance Array, Coastal Pioneer Array and Global Irminger Sea Array.\n",
    "Each has a unique location(s), history and relevance to global ocean research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the agenda of this repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrate data interpretation; first as a **technical process** and\n",
    "second in terms of ocean science. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some technical details to watch out for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open and subset a NetCDF data file via the `xarray Dataset`  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data provided by OOI tends to be \"not ready for use\". There are several steps needed; and\n",

    "- Convert the principal dimension from `obs` or `row` to `time` \n",
    "    - `obs/row` are generic terms with values running 1, 2, 3... (hinders combining files into longer time series)\n",
    "- Re-name certain data variables for easier use; and delete anything that is not of interest\n",
    "- Identify the time range of interest\n",
    "- Write a specific subset file\n",

    "### Depth and time\n",
    "\n",

    "### Some complicating data features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some signals may have dropouts: Missing data is usually flagged as `NaN`\n",
    "    - See the section above on using the xarray `.dropna(dimension)` feature to clean this up\n",
    "- Nitrate data also features ***dark sample*** data\n",
    "- Spectrophotometer instruments measure both ***optical absorption*** and ***beam attenuation***\n",
    "    - For both of these about 82 individual channel values are recorded\n",
    "        - Each channel is centered at a unique wavelength in the visible spectrum\n",
    "        - The wavelength channels are separated by about 4 nm\n",
    "        - The data are noisy\n",
    "        - Some channels contain no data\n",
    "    - Sampling frequency needed\n",
    "- Spectral irradiance carries seven channels (wavelengths) of data\n",
    "- Current measurements give three axis results: north, east, up\n",

    "### Data product levels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \n",
    "[OOI Data Catalog Documentation](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/help/overview.html#data-products) \n",
    "describes three levels of data product, summarized: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 1 ***Instrument deployment***: Unprocessed, parsed data parameter that is in instrument/sensor \n",
    "units and resolution. See note below defining a *deployment*. This is not data we are interested in using, as a rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 1+ ***Full-instrument time series***: A join of recovered and telemetered \n",
    "streams for non-cabled instrument deployments. For high-resolution cabled and recovered data, this product is \n",
    "binned to 1-minute resolution to allow for efficient visualization and downloads for users that do not need \n",
    "the full-resolution, gold copy (Level 2) time series. We'd like to hold out for 'gold standard'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 2 ***Full-resolution, gold standard time series***: The calibrated full-resolution dataset \n",
    "(scientific units). L2 data have been processed, pre-built, and served \n",
    "from the OOI system to the \n",
    "[OOI Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/)\n",
    "and to Users. The mechanisms are THREDDS and ERDDAP; file format  \n",
    "NetCDF-CF. There is one file for every instrument, stream, and deployment.  For more refer to this\n",
    "[Data Download](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/help/overview.html#download-data-map-overview) link.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOI terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **instrument**: A physical device with one or more sensors.\n",
    "- **stream**: Sensor data.\n",
    "- **deployment**: The act of putting infrastructure in the water, or the length of \n",
    "time between a platform going in the water and being recovered and brought back to shore.There are \n",
    "multiple deployment files per instrument. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shallow profiler overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployments run 2015 to present; with intermittent interruptions due to servicing and *force majeure*. \n",
    "There are three shallow profilers in the cabled array:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "2. 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "3. 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and sits 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection back to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile it is winched back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean time in minutes for...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ascent:    67\n",
    "Descent:   45      (exception: local noon and midnight descents are about an hour longer)\n",
    "Rest:      45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shallow profiler + platform data considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the data are acquired by instruments / sensors on a continuous basis. This means that \n",
    "data acquired on the *platform* can be compared to parked *profiler* data. (See related notebook.)\n",
    "Other data are acquired only at particular parts of the profiling sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler\n",
    "rises through and disturbs the water on ascent; and then is winched back down. Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform.\n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To help economize the code I have implemented single-letter codes for the various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Temporary fixed width font section should be replaced with a table\n",
