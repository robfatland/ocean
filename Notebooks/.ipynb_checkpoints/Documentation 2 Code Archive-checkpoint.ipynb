    "to within about 10 meters of the surface. As the ascend and descend they record data. The resting location in\n",
    "between these excursions is a platform 200 meters below the surface that is anchored to the see floor. The platform\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with shallow profiler ascent/descent/rest cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is out of sequence intentionally. The topics that follow are in more of a logical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue at hand is that the shallow profiler ascends and descends and rests about nine times per\n",
    "day; but the time of day when these events happen is not perfectly fixed. As a result we need \n",
    "a means to identify the start and end times of (say) an ascent so that we can be confident that\n",
    "the data were in fact acquired as the profiler ascended through the water column. This is also \n",
    "useful for comparing ascent to descent data or comparing profiler-at-rest data to platform data\n",
    "(since the profiler is at rest *on* the platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To restate the task: From a conceptual { time window } we would like very specific { metadata }\n",
    "for time windows when the profiler ascended while collecting data. \n",
    "That is, we want accurate subsidiary time windows for successive profiles within our conceptual\n",
    "time window; per site and year.\n",
    "We can then use these specific { time window } boundaries to select data\n",
    "subsets from corresponding profiling runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this process is to get CTD data for the shallow profiler since it will have a\n",
    "record of depth over time. This record is scanned in one-year chunks to identify the UTM start\n",
    "times of each successive profile. Also determined: The start times of descents and the start times of rests. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From these three sets of timestamps we can make the assumption that the end of an \n",
    "ascent corresponds to the start of a descent. Likewise the end of a descent is the start of \n",
    "a rest; and the start of an ascent is the end of the previous rest. Each ascent / descent / rest\n",
    "interval is considered as one profile (in that order). The results are written to a CSV file\n",
    "that has one row of timing metadata per profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose the goal is to create a sequence of temperature plots for July 2019 for the Axial \n",
    "Base shallow profiler. First we would identify the pre-existing CSV file for Axial Base for the\n",
    "year 2019 and read that file into a pandas Dataframe. Let's suppose it is read into a profile\n",
    "Dataframe called `p` and that we have labled the six columns that correspond to\n",
    "ascent start/end, descent start/end and rest start/ned. Here is example code from `BioOpticsModule.py`.\n",
