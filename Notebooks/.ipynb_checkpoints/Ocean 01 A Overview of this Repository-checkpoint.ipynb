    "These notebooks tell a series of *data interpretation* stories. The mechanics of getting the \n",
    "data in place are thinly veiled: The heavy lifting code is relegated to modules. These modules\n",
    "have names like `NotebookModule.py` and they feature `# comments` that are intended to demystify\n",
    "what is going on. So that is how a prospective scientist would be able to build from what is\n",
    "shown here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To return to the data stories: The goal is to survey both within the OOI diaspora of sensors and\n",

    "The initial focus is the cabled array shallow profiler. \n",
    "Need a link here. \n",
    "The shallow profilers \n",
    "consist of two connected entities: The **profiler** and the **platform**. Both generate data. \n",

    "\n",
    "### What is OOI?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOI stands for Ocean Observatories Initiative. It is a collection of **arrays** which are distributions\n",
    "of scientific instruments. To date there are six arrays: Four in the northern hemisphere and two in \n",
    "the southern ocean. The southern ocean arrays operated for a few years but are now discontinued. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the agenda of this repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Agenda: Demonstrate data interpretation; first as a **technical process** and\n",
    "second in terms of ocean science. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Open and subset a NetCDF data file via the `xarray Dataset`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert the principal dimension from `obs` or `row` to `time` \n",
    "    - `obs/row` are generic terms with values running 1, 2, 3... (hinders combining files into longer time series)\n",
    "- Re-name certain data variables for easier use; and delete anything that is not of interest\n",
    "- Identify the time range of interest\n",
    "- Write a specific subset file\n",
    "    - For example: Subset files that are small can live within the repo\n",

    "\n",
    "The \n",
    "[OOI Data Catalog Documentation](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/help/overview.html#data-products) \n",
    "describes three levels of data product, summarized: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 1 ***Instrument deployment***: Unprocessed, parsed data parameter that is in instrument/sensor \n",
    "units and resolution. See note below defining a *deployment*. This is not data we are interested in using, as a rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 1+ ***Full-instrument time series***: A join of recovered and telemetered \n",
    "streams for non-cabled instrument deployments. For high-resolution cabled and recovered data, this product is \n",
    "binned to 1-minute resolution to allow for efficient visualization and downloads for users that do not need \n",
    "the full-resolution, gold copy (Level 2) time series. We'd like to hold out for 'gold standard'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 2 ***Full-resolution, gold standard time series***: The calibrated full-resolution dataset \n",
    "(scientific units). L2 data have been processed, pre-built, and served \n",
    "from the OOI system to the \n",
    "[OOI Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/)\n",
    "and to Users. The mechanisms are THREDDS and ERDDAP; file format  \n",
    "NetCDF-CF. There is one file for every instrument, stream, and deployment.  For more refer to this\n",

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **instrument**: A physical device with one or more sensors.\n",
    "- **stream**: Sensor data.\n",
    "- **deployment**: The act of putting infrastructure in the water, or the length of \n",
    "time between a platform going in the water and being recovered and brought back to shore.There are \n",
    "multiple deployment files per instrument. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Shallow profiler overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployments run 2015 to present; with intermittent interruptions due to servicing and *force majeure*. \n",
    "There are three shallow profilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "2. 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "3. 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and sits 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection back to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Profiler\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile it is winched back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "From notebook **Ocean 01 D** which characterizes profile ascent/descent/rest intervals: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean time in minutes for...\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascent:    67\n",
    "Descent:   45           2 of each day's 9 descents have built-in equilibration stops that extend their duration\n",
    "Rest:      45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shallow profiler + platform data considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are acquired by the basic instruments / sensors on a continuous basis. This means that \n",
    "data acquired on the *platform* can be compared to parked *profiler* data. (See related notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The profiler\n",
    "rises through and disturbs the water on ascent; and then is winched back down. Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "(There is an ascent / descent comparison notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform. \n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To help economize the code I have implemented single-letter codes for the various data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Temporary fixed width font section should be replaced with a table\n",
