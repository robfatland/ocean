    "# Ocean Science Data Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Book is about *ocean science* by means of *data interpretation*.\n",
    "There is a barrier between observatories that collect data and people \n",
    "constructively looking at and thinking about \n",
    "that data. This barrier consists\n",
    "of a collection of technologies: Necessary to make progress but \n",
    "requiring time and effort to put into practice. \n",
    "The ambitious goal of this book is to \n",
    "streamline the data interpretation story and at the same time provide \n",
    "some of the keys to overcoming this technical barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin let's start to build a model or framework for understanding\n",
    "the ocean. Understand that the ocean is dark below a certain depth.\n",
    "Imagine we are at the surface during the daytime, in bright sunlight; \n",
    "and we start to descend downwards.  With increasing depth the sunlight \n",
    "gradually grows fainter until it is nearly pitch black\n",
    "down around a depth of perhaps 200 meters. This upper 200 meters \n",
    "of the ocean is the *photic zone*. This is where sunlight\n",
    "is available as a direct energy source, particularly\n",
    "to phytoplankton ('plant-like plankton') which form the base level \n",
    "of the ocean food web. Phytoplankton use available chemicals\n",
    "and sunlight to store energy as carbohydrates, a first step \n",
    "in establishing an active ecosystem in the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the photic zone as a starting point let's now jump ahead to\n",
    "human activity, particularly our attempts to observe and understand\n",
    "the ocean and more generally the earth system. In the US\n",
    "the National Science Foundation has supported a program \n",
    "called OOI, which stands for Ocean Observatories Initiative. \n",
    "OOI is a collection of **arrays**,\n",
    "that are in turn collections of sensors and support hardware. \n",
    "A single one of these arrays has an area of several \n",
    "thousand square kilometers.\n",
    "There are seven arrays in the OOI program: Five in the \n",
    "northern hemisphere and two in the southern ocean. \n",
    "The southern ocean arrays operated for \n",
    "a few years starting in 2014 but have since been discontinued. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The five northern hemisphere arrays are the Regional Cabled Array,\n",
    "Global Station Papa Array, \n",
    "the Coastal Endurance Array, \n",
    "the Coastal Pioneer Array and the Global Irminger Sea Array.\n",
    "Each has its own unique location, history and relevance to ocean science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Regional Cabled Array (RCA) is located off the Oregon coast and extends across the continental\n",
    "shelf and several hundred kilometers further out into the deep ocean. \n",
    "This array, the RCA, is the starting\n",
    "point for the data interpretation stories unfolded here. \n",
    "Among many other instruments, the RCA features three shallow profilers\n",
    "that are designed to observe the photic zone in great detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "- 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "- 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary, at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and rests 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Platform and Profiler together look like this: \n",

    "Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) \n",
    "nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler \n",
    "ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile \n",
    "it is winched back down again. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; \n",
    "although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform.\n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. "
