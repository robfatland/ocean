    "# Ocean Science Data Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This book concerns *ocean science* via *data interpretation*. \n",
    "We begin by building a model of how the ocean works, eventually\n",
    "turning to data to refine that model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ocean is illuminated from above by sunlight that penetrates\n",
    "to a depth of about 200 meters (630 feet). \n",
    "    - Beneath this upper layer the ocean is always dark, regardless of time of day\n",
    "- The upper 200 meters of the ocean is the *photic zone*\n",
    "    - Sunlight is available as an energy source\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton ('plant-like plankton') make use of this energy\n",
    "        - As a consequence they are the base level of the food web\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton use available chemicals and sunlight to store energy\n",
    "        - The primary storage medium is carbohydrates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider the source of ocean data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the US the National Science Foundation supports an observatory program\n",
    "    - It is OOI, abbreviating Ocean Observatories Initiative \n",
    "    - OOI is subdivided into smaller components\n",
    "        - The first subcomponent is a collection of **arrays**\n",
    "        - Arrays are in turn collections of sensors and support hardware \n",
    "    - A single array has an area of several thousand square kilometers\n",
    "    - There are seven arrays in the OOI program\n",
    "        - Two arrays were built in the southern ocean\n",
    "            - The southern ocean arrays began operation in 2014\n",
    "                - They have since been decommissioned\n",
    "        - Five arrays were built in the northern hemisphere\n",
    "            - The Regional Cabled Array (Pacific ocean)\n",
    "            - The Global Station Papa Array (Pacific ocean)\n",
    "            - The Coastal Endurance Array (Pacific ocean)\n",
    "            - The Coastal Pioneer Array (Atlantic ocean)\n",
    "            - The Global Irminger Sea Array (Atlantic ocean)\n",
    "    - The Regional Cabled Array (RCA) is our focus here\n",
    "        - The RCA is located off the Oregon coast \n",
    "        - It extends several hundred kilometers off shore\n",
    "            - This extends beyond the continental shelf into the deep ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RCA features three shallow profilers\n",
    "that are designed to observe the photic zone in great detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "- 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "- 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary, at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shallow profiler **platform** is tethered to\n",
    "the sea floor by means of two long cables. It is positively buoyant and rests 200 meters below \n",
    "the surface. The platform has both power and a data connection to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **profiler** rests in a cradle on the **platform**. \n",
    "It is also positively buoyant. Platform and Profiler together look like this: \n",

    "Under normal circumstances\n",
    "this profiler is allowed to rise to near the surface (depth of approximately 10 meters) \n",
    "nine times each day. \n",
    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler \n",
    "ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",
    "sensors acquire data. Once the profiler reaches the top of the profile \n",

    "Ascent data are\n",
    "considered more pristine; \n",
    "although pH and pCO2 are unique in that they are recorded on *descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows data available from the profiler and its 200m-depth retaining platform.\n",
    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
    "in decibars and depth in meters are very nearly the same. Charts of sensor value against depth \n",
    "effectively treat profiles as \"instantaneous\" snapshots of upper water column. "
