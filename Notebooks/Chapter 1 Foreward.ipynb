    "# Ocean Science Data Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This book concerns *ocean science* via *data interpretation*. \n",
    "We begin by building a model of how the ocean works, eventually\n",
    "turning to data to refine that model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ocean is illuminated from above by sunlight that penetrates\n",
    "to a depth of about 200 meters\n",
    "    - Beneath this upper layer the ocean is always dark, regardless of time of day\n",
    "- The upper 200 meters of the ocean is the *photic zone*\n",
    "    - Sunlight is available as an energy source\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton ('plant-like plankton') make use of this energy\n",
    "        - They are the base level of the food web\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton use available chemicals and sunlight to store energy\n",
    "        - The primary storage medium is carbohydrates\n",
    "\n",

    "Now let's consider sources of ocean data\n",

    "- In the US: The National Science Foundation supports an ocean observatory\n",
    "    - OOI = the ***Ocean Observatories Initiative*** \n",
    "    - OOI is subdivided into components called **arrays**\n",
    "        - Arrays are operated cooperatively but somewhat independently\n",
    "        - Arrays have, in turn, various collections of sensors and support hardware \n",
    "        - A single array can span an area of several thousand square kilometers\n",
    "        - There are seven arrays in the OOI program\n",
    "        - Two arrays were built in the southern ocean\n",
    "            - The southern ocean arrays began operation in 2014\n",
    "                - They have since been decommissioned\n",
    "        - Five more arrays were built in the northern hemisphere\n",

    "- It extends several hundred kilometers off-shore\n",
    "- The RCA extends beyond the continental shelf out into the deep ocean\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The RCA features three shallow profilers designed to observe the photic zone \n",
    "in great detail.\n",
    "These shallow profilers are **platforms** tethered to the sea floor by means of two \n",
    "long cables. Each platform is positively buoyant, positioned at a depth of 200 meters \n",
    "below the ocean surface. The platform has both power and a data connection to shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 500m depth: Outer edge of the continental shelf off of central Oregon\n",
    "- 3100m depth: Further out at the base of the continental shelf off central Oregon\n",
    "- 2100m depth: At the Juan de Fuca plate boundary, at the base of Axial Seamount\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "This is accomplished by means of a single cable on a winch. As the profiler \n",
    "ascends its \"upward facing\"\n",

    "Pressure, density, salinity, temperature and depth are interrelated. In particular, pressure \n",
