    "### Working with shallow profiler ascent/descent/rest cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is out of sequence intentionally. The topics that follow are in more of a logical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue at hand is that the shallow profiler ascends and descends and rests about nine times per\n",
    "day; but the time of day when these events happen is not perfectly fixed. As a result we need \n",
    "a means to identify the start and end times of (say) an ascent so that we can be confident that\n",
    "the data were in fact acquired as the profiler ascended through the water column. This is also \n",
    "useful for comparing ascent to descent data or comparing profiler-at-rest data to platform data\n",
    "(since the profiler is at rest *on* the platform).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To restate the task: From a conceptual { time window } we would like very specific { metadata }\n",
    "for time windows when the profiler ascended while collecting data. \n",
    "That is, we want accurate subsidiary time windows for successive profiles within our conceptual\n",
    "time window; per site and year.\n",
    "We can then use these specific { time window } boundaries to select data\n",
    "subsets from corresponding profiling runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this process is to get CTD data for the shallow profiler since it will have a\n",
    "record of depth over time. This record is scanned in one-year chunks to identify the UTM start\n",
    "times of each successive profile. Also determined: The start times of descents and the start times of rests. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From these three sets of timestamps we can make the assumption that the end of an \n",
    "ascent corresponds to the start of a descent. Likewise the end of a descent is the start of \n",
    "a rest; and the start of an ascent is the end of the previous rest. Each ascent / descent / rest\n",
    "interval is considered as one profile (in that order). The results are written to a CSV file\n",
    "that has one row of timing metadata per profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose the goal is to create a sequence of temperature plots for July 2019 for the Axial \n",
    "Base shallow profiler. First we would identify the pre-existing CSV file for Axial Base for the\n",
    "year 2019 and read that file into a pandas Dataframe. Let's suppose it is read into a profile\n",
    "Dataframe called `p` and that we have labled the six columns that correspond to\n",
    "ascent start/end, descent start/end and rest start/ned. Here is example code from `BioOpticsModule.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p = pd.read_csv(metadata_filename, usecols=[\"1\", \"3\", \"5\", \"7\", \"9\", \"11\"])\n",
    "p.columns          = ['ascent_start', 'ascent_end', 'descent_start', 'descent_end', 'rest_start', 'rest_end']\n",
    "p['ascent_start']  = pd.to_datetime(pDf['ascent_start'])\n",
    "p['ascent_end']    = pd.to_datetime(pDf['ascent_end'])\n",
    "p['descent_start'] = pd.to_datetime(pDf['descent_start'])\n",
    "p['descent_end']   = pd.to_datetime(pDf['descent_end'])\n",
    "p['rest_start']    = pd.to_datetime(pDf['rest_start'])\n",
    "p['rest_end']      = pd.to_datetime(pDf['rest_end'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine two rows of this Dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(p['ascent_start'][0])\n",
    "\n",
    "2019-01-01 00:27:00\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p['ascent_start'][1600])\n",
    "\n",
    "2019-07-04 15:47:00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, row 0 corresponds to the start of 2019, January 1, and row 1600 occurs on July 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 365 day year with no\n",
    "missed profiles (9 profiles per day) this file would contain 365 * 9 = 3285 profiles. In practice\n",
    "there will be fewer owing to storms or other factors that interrupt data acquisition. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of this dataframe corresponds to a profile run (ascent, descent, rest) of the shallow\n",
    "profiler. Consequently we could use the time boundaries of one such row to select data that was\n",
    "acquired *during the ascent period of that profile*. Suppose a temperature dataset for the month of July \n",
    "is called `T`. `T` is constructed as an xarray Dataset with dimension `time`. \n",
    "We can use the xarray *select* method `.sel`, as in `T.sel(time=slice(time0, time1))`, to\n",
    "produce a Dataset with only times \n",
    "that fall within a profile ascent window.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "time0    = p['ascent_start'][1600]\n",
    "time1    = p['ascent_end'][1600]\n",
    "T_ascent = T.sel(time=slice(time0, time1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `T_ascent` will contain about 60 minutes worth of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates loading time boundaries from the metadata `p`. \n",
    "The metadata informs the small time box. Now we need the other direction \n",
    "as well: Suppose the interval of interest is the first four days of July 2019.\n",
    "We have no idea which rows of the metadata `p` this corresponds to. We need\n",
    "a list of row indices for `p` in that time window. For this we \n",
    "have a utility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def GenerateTimeWindowIndices(pDf, date0, date1, time0, time1):\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    Given two day boundaries and a time window (UTC) within a day: Return a list\n",
    "    of indices of profiles that start within both the day and time bounds. This \n",
    "    works from the passed dataframe of profile times.\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    nprofiles = len(pDf)\n",

    "    return pIndices\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has both a date range and a time-of-day range. The resulting row index list corresponds\n",
    "to profiles that satisfy both time window constraints: Date and time of day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-result is this: We can go from a conceptual { time window } to a list of { metadata rows }, i.e. a\n",
    "list of integer row numbers, using the above utility function. Within the metadata structure `p` we can \n",
    "use these rows to look up ascent / descent / rest times for profiles.\n",
