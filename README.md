# Introduction to the **ocean** GitHub repository

This [ocean science repository](https://github.com/robfatland/ocean) is a collection of Python Jupyter 
notebooks and supporting data. 
It primarily concerns data interpretation and supporting technical detail. 


The *'Binder'* badge (above) opens a sandbox version
of this repository in a matter of a few minutes. Once this is completed, double-click
the **BioOptics** notebook to view its contents. Check the **`Notebooks`** sub-folder for more.


To work from a copy of this repository: Establish a stable Jupyter notebook server environment 
and use `git clone https://github.com/robfatland/ocean.git`. 


The data interpretation here begins with **shallow profilers** located in the
[Regional Cabled Array (RCA)](https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu).
The RCA is
in turn one of the seven arrays that comprise the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), 
sponsored by the National Science Foundation. 
Additional datasets are included that originate from other ocean research programs.
